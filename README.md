Description:
A basic photo sharing app with User control and OAuth2 login.
Uses Devise for user login, Omniauth of OAuth and OpenID intregration, Bootstrap for responsive frontend and CarrierWave for photo uploads.
Added a like and comment feature, and currently there is no option to delete comment and unlike, will be coming in next updates.
The public/image folder has now been added to .gitignore because files uploaded locally have been stored there and are of no use.
The current database.yml uses my mysql configuration on local server, which needs to be changed for each user.
More updates coming soon. I won't stop working on this as this is a nice platform to learn and explore rails...

Possible expansions-
Users liking comments, unlike and uncomment, follow users and a notification panel + timeline.
